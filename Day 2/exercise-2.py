# In this exercise we are going to take a double digit number and add the two single numbers together.

# Here, we are separating the two integers as a string.
first_digit_number = two_digit_number[0]
second_digit_number = two_digit_number[1]

# Then we are turning the two string numbers into integers and adding them together.
result = int(first_digit_number) + int(second_digit_number)

# Printing out the result.
print( result )
